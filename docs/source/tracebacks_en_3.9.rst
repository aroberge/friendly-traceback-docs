Friendly tracebacks - in English
======================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Below, we can find some examples. SyntaxError cases, as well as TabError and
IndentationError cases, are shown in a separate page.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     C:\Users\andre\github\friendly-traceback\tests\trb_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.1.1a
Python version: 3.9.0



ArithmeticError
---------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        ArithmeticError: 
        
    `ArithmeticError` is the base class for those built-in exceptions
    that are raised for various arithmetic errors.
    It is unusual that you are seeing this exception;
    normally, a more specific exception should have been raised.
    
    Exception raised on line 9 of file 'TESTS:\except\test_arithmetic_error.py'.
    
        7:         # Usually, a subclass such as ZeroDivisionError, etc., would
        8:         # likely be raised.

--------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        AttributeError: type object 'A' has no attribute 'x'
        
    An `AttributeError` occurs when the code contains something like
        `object.x`
    and `x` is not a method or attribute (variable) belonging to `object`.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In your program, the object is `A` and the attribute is `x`.
        
    Exception raised on line 10 of file 'TESTS:\except\test_attribute_error.py'.

    An `AttributeError` occurs when the code contains something like
        `object.x`
    and `x` is not a method or attribute (variable) belonging to `object`.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        Perhaps you meant to write `ascii_lowercase` instead of `ascii_lowecase`
        
    Exception raised on line 25 of file 'TESTS:\except\test_attribute_error.py'.

    An `AttributeError` occurs when the code contains something like
        `object.x`
    and `x` is not a method or attribute (variable) belonging to `object`.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        Instead of writing `cost`, perhaps you meant one of the following:

    A `FileNotFoundError` exception indicates that you
    are trying to open a file that cannot be found by Python.
    This could be because you misspelled the name of the file.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In your program, the name of the
        file that cannot be found is `does_not_exist`.

    It can also be raised directly by codecs.lookup().
    
    Exception raised on line 10 of file 'TESTS:\except\test_lookup_error.py'.
    
        8:         # other than possibly codecs.lookup(), which is why we raise

    An `IndexError` occurs when you are try to get an item from a list,
    a tuple, or a similar object (sequence), by using an index which
    does not exists; typically, this is because the index you give
    is greater than the length of the sequence.

    A `NameError` exception indicates that a variable or
    function name is not known to Python.
    Most often, this is because there is a spelling mistake.
    However, sometimes it is because the name is used
    before being defined or given a value.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In your program, the unknown name is `something`.
        
    Exception raised on line 6 of file 'TESTS:\except\test_name_error.py'.

    Most often, this is because there is a spelling mistake.
    However, sometimes it is because the name is used
    before being defined or given a value.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In your program, the unknown name is `babs`.
        Instead of writing `babs`, perhaps you meant one of the following:

    Most often, this is because there is a spelling mistake.
    However, sometimes it is because the name is used

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In your program, the unknown name is `x`.

TypeError - 15a: list object is not callable
--------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        TypeError: 'list' object is not callable
        
    A `TypeError` is usually caused by trying
    to combine two incompatible types of objects,
    by calling a function with the wrong type of object,
    or by tring to do an operation not allowed on a given type of object.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        I suspect that you had an object of this type, a `list`,
        followed by what looked like a tuple, '(...)',
        which Python took as an indication of a function call.
        Perhaps you had a missing comma before the tuple.

TypeError - 16: exception derived from BaseException
----------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        TypeError: exceptions must derive from BaseException
        
    A `TypeError` is usually caused by trying
    to combine two incompatible types of objects,
    by calling a function with the wrong type of object,
    or by tring to do an operation not allowed on a given type of object.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In Python 3, exceptions must be derived from BaseException.

UnboundLocalError
-----------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        UnboundLocalError: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment
        
    In Python, variables that are used inside a function are known as 
    local variables. Before they are used, they must be assigned a value.
    A variable that is used before it is assigned a value is assumed to
    be defined outside that function; it is known as a `global`
    (or sometimes `nonlocal`) variable. You cannot assign a value to such
    a global variable inside a function without first indicating to
    Python that this is a global variable, otherwise you will see
    an `UnboundLocalError`.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        The variable that appears to cause the problem is `a`.
        Perhaps the statement
        
            global a
        
        should have been included as the first line inside your function.

Unknown exception

ZeroDivisionError - 1
---------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
        
    A `ZeroDivisionError` occurs when you are attempting to divide
    a value by zero:
        `result = my_variable / 0.`
    It can also happen if you calculate the remainder of a division
    using the modulo operator `%`:
        `result = my_variable % 0`
