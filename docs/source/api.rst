==========

.. note::

    The following is extracted from ``public_api.py``. 
    Please feel free to make suggestions if you believe that other 
    functions should be added to this public API.


.. important::

    Sphynx processes automatically the information from the module.
    If you want to use functions from the public API, ignore
    the ``.public_api`` part of the names and use simply
    ``friendly_traceback.some_function()``.
