Friendly tracebacks - in English
======================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Below, we can find some examples. SyntaxError cases, as well as TabError and
IndentationError cases, are shown in a separate page.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.2.34a
Python version: 3.6.8

        You have a circular import.
        
    An `ImportError` exception indicates that a certain object could not

    The module or package where it was
