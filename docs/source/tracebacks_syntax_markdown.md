## IndentationError: expected an indented block


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error1.py", line 4
    pass
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block

```

An `IndentationError` occurs when a given line of code is
not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error1.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: '''Should raise IndentationError'''
       2: 
       3: if True:
    -->4: pass
          ^

```

In this case, the line identified above
was expected to begin a new indented block.

## IndentationError: unexpected indent


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error2.py", line 4
    pass
   ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent

```

An `IndentationError` occurs when a given line of code is
not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error2.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: '''Should raise IndentationError'''
       2: if True:
       3:     pass
    -->4:       pass
               ^

```

In this case, the line identified above
is more indented than expected and 
does not match the indentation of the previous line.

---

## IndentationError: unindent does not match ...


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error3.py", line 4
    pass
        ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level

```

An `IndentationError` occurs when a given line of code is
not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error3.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: '''Should raise IndentationError'''
       2: if True:
       3:       pass
    -->4:     pass
                  ^

```

In this case, the line identified above is
less indented than the preceding one,
and is not aligned vertically with another block of code.

---

## TabError


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_tab_error.py", line 7
    pass
        ^
TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation

```

A `TabError` indicates that you have used both spaces
and tab characters to indent your code.
This is not allowed in Python.
Indenting your code means to have block of codes aligned vertically
by inserting either spaces or tab characters at the beginning of lines.
Python's recommendation is to always use spaces to indent your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_tab_error.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
        4: 
        5: def test_tab_error():
        6:     if True:
    --> 7: 	pass
                ^

```

## Assign to keyword


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error1.py", line 3
    def = 2
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error1.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: """ Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: def = 2
              ^

```

I make an effort below to guess what caused the problem
but I might guess incorrectly.

You were trying to assign a value to the Python keyword `def`.
This is not allowed.

## Missing colon - if


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)

       4:     pass

```

I make an effort below to guess what caused the problem
but I might guess incorrectly.

You wrote a `while` loop but
forgot to add a colon `:` at the end

               ^
       6:     print('ok')

```

I make an effort below to guess what caused the problem
but I might guess incorrectly.

You likely meant to use Python's `elif` keyword
but wrote `else if` instead

```

You are including the statement

    `    global x`

indicating that `x` is a variable defined outside a function.
You are also using the same `x` as an argument for that
function, thus indicating that it should be variable known only
inside that function, which is the contrary of what `global` implied.

```

One of the following two possibilities could be the cause:
1. You meant to do a comparison with == and wrote = instead.
2. You called a function with a named argument:

       a_function(invalid=something)

where `invalid` is not a valid variable name in Python
either because it starts with a number, or is a string,
or contains a period, etc.

              ^

```

I make an effort below to guess what caused the problem
but I might guess incorrectly.

You are using the backquote character.
Either you meant to write a single quote, ', or copied Python 2 code;
in this latter case, use the function `repr(x)`.

          ^

```

On the left-hand side of an equal sign, you have a
conditional expression instead of the name of a variable.
A conditional expression has the following form:

    variable = object if condition else other_object

       3: 
       4: def f(x):
    -->5:     nonlocal x
              ^

```

You used `x` as a parameter for a function
before declaring it also as a nonlocal variable:
`x` cannot be both at the same time.

---

## Name is global and nonlocal


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks

    --> 7:     global xy
               ^
        8:     nonlocal xy

```

You declared `xy` as being both a global and nonlocal variable.
A variable can be global, or nonlocal, but not both at the same time.

       4: def f():
    -->5:     nonlocal ab
              ^

```

You declared the variable `ab` as being a
nonlocal variable but it cannot be found.

---

## nonlocal variable not found at module level

       2: 
       3: 
    -->4: nonlocal cd
          ^

```

You used the nonlocal keyword at a module level.
The nonlocal keyword refers to a variable inside a function
given a value outside that function.

---

## Keyword arg only once in function definition

       3: 
    -->4: def f(aa=1, aa=2):
          ^
       5:     pass

You have defined a function repeating the keyword argument

    aa
twice; each keyword argument should appear only once in a function definition.

       3: 
    -->4: f(ad=1, ad=2)
                  ^

```

You have called a function repeating the same keyword argument.
Each keyword argument should appear only once in a function call.

---

## IndentationError/SyntaxError depending on version

```

I make an effort below to guess what caused the problem
but I might guess incorrectly.

In older version of Python, `print` was a keyword.
Now, `print` is a function; you need to use parentheses to call it.

## Invalid character (bad quote)


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error75.py", line 3
    a = « hello »
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier

```

Did you mean to use a normal quote character, `'` or `"`?



A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error75.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier for Python <=3.8
       2:    and  SyntaxError: invalid character '«' (U+00AB) in Python 3.9"""
    -->3: a = « hello »
              ^

```

Python indicates that you used some unicode characters not allowed
as part of a variable name; this includes many emojis.
However, I suspect that you used a fancy unicode quotation mark
instead of a normal single or double quote for a string.
This can happen if you copy-pasted code.

```

I make an effort below to guess what caused the problem
but I might guess incorrectly.

Python indicates that the error is caused by `y` written just after `x`.
Perhaps you forgot a comma or an operator, like `+`, `*`, `in`, etc., between `x` and `y`.

          ^

```

You wrote an expression that includes some mathematical operations
on the left-hand side of the equal sign which should be
only used to assign a value to a variable.
Perhaps you meant to write `a_b` instead of `a-b`

The star operator `*` is interpreted to mean that
iterable unpacking is to be used to assign a name
to each item of an iterable, which does not make sense here.

but I might guess incorrectly.

The double star operator `**` is likely interpreted to mean that
dict unpacking is to be used which does not make sense here.

You cannot be serious!

In case this is a mistake in a real program, please
consider reducing the number of nested code blocks.

    -->4: def f(*):
                ^
       5:     pass

Assuming you were defining a function, you need
to replace `*` by either `*arguments` or
by `*, named_argument=value`.

                 ^

```

I make an effort below to guess what caused the problem
but I might guess incorrectly.

Valid names cannot begin with a number.
Perhaps you thought that `i` could be used to represent
the square root of -1. In Python, `j` (or `1j`) is used for this
and perhaps you meant to write `3.0j`.

I suspect you wrote `from __future__ import braces` following
someone else's suggestion. This will never work.

Unlike other programming languages, Python's code block are defined by
their indentation level, and not by using some curly braces, like `{...}`.

A `from __future__ import` statement changes the way Python
interprets the code in a file.
It must appear at the beginning of the file.
