more()
=======

After a while, users do not need to see the display of ``what()`` as
they have learned to recognize most exceptions. However, after
seeing a traceback, they might want to see more information
about ``where()`` and ``why()``: this is what ``more()`` does.

We purposely do not show an example, and leave it up to you to try!
If you do so, please let us know if you think it should act differently.
