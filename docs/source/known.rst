Generic information about various exceptions
==============================================

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     what.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

This file contains the generic information provided by
Friendly-traceback about built-in exceptions.
By "generic information" we mean the information provided using
``what()`` in a friendly console.

Some exceptions will never be seen by users of Friendly-traceback.

For example, ``SystemExit`` and ``KeyboardInterrupt`` are never
intercepted by Friendly-traceback. Furthermore, exceptions such as
``GeneratorExit``, ``FloatingPointError``, and
``StopAsyncIteration``, would likely never be seen.

``FloatingPointError`` is actually
`not used by Python <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/exceptions.html#FloatingPointError>`_.

``BaseException``, ``Exception``, and ``ArithmeticError`` are base classes which
are also not normally seen: some derived classes are normally used instead.

Information compiled using Friendly version: 0.3.142,
Python version: 3.8.10




Exceptions
----------

ArithmeticError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    `ArithmeticError` is the base class for those built-in exceptions
    that are raised for various arithmetic errors.
    It is unusual that you are seeing this exception;
    normally, a more specific exception should have been raised.

AssertionError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    In Python, the keyword `assert` is used in statements of the form
    `assert condition`, to confirm that `condition` is not `False`,
    nor equivalent to `False` such as an empty list, etc.
    If `condition` is `False` or equivalent, an `AssertionError` is raised.

AttributeError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    An `AttributeError` occurs when the code contains something like
        `object.x`
    and `x` is not a method or attribute (variable) belonging to `object`.

    It can also be raised directly by codecs.lookup().

MemoryError
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    A `ModuleNotFoundError` exception indicates that you
    are trying to import a module that cannot be found by Python.

TabError
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    A `TabError` indicates that you have used both spaces
    and tab characters to indent your code.
    This is not allowed in Python.
    Indenting your code means to have block of codes aligned vertically
    by inserting either spaces or tab characters at the beginning of lines.
    Python's recommendation is to always use spaces to indent your code.

    or by trying to do an operation not allowed on a given type of object.

UnboundLocalError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    In Python, variables that are used inside a function are known as 
    local variables. Before they are used, they must be assigned a value.
    A variable that is used before it is assigned a value is assumed to
    be defined outside that function; it is known as a `global`
    (or sometimes `nonlocal`) variable. You cannot assign a value to such
    a global variable inside a function without first indicating to
    Python that this is a global variable, otherwise you will see
    an `UnboundLocalError`.
