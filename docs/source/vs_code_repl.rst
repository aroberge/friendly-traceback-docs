Visual Studio Code's terminal
===============================

You can start the friendly console in Visual Studio Code's terminal
in the same way as mentioned before::

    python -m friendly_traceback

   :scale: 50 %

This is designed for a dark coloured terminal; the closer the
background to your chosen VS code theme is to black, the
better it likely will look.

If you use a light coloured theme, you should use the
following instead:

    python -m friendly_traceback --style light
