Friendly tracebacks - in English
======================================

Friendly aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Below, we can find some examples. SyntaxError cases, as well as TabError and
IndentationError cases, are shown in a separate page.
Not all cases handled by friendly are included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

Friendly version: 0.3.142
Python version: 3.7.8

    `ArithmeticError` is the base class for those built-in exceptions
    that are raised for various arithmetic errors.
    It is unusual that you are seeing this exception;
    normally, a more specific exception should have been raised.

    AssertionError: Fake message
    
    In Python, the keyword `assert` is used in statements of the form
    `assert condition`, to confirm that `condition` is not `False`,
    nor equivalent to `False` such as an empty list, etc.
    
    If `condition` is `False` or equivalent, an `AssertionError` is raised.

    An `AttributeError` occurs when the code contains something like
        `object.x`

    This should not happen:
    Python tells us that module `my_turtle1` does not have an attribute named `something`.
    However, it does not appear that module `my_turtle1` was imported.
    I suspect that you used the name `my_turtle1.py` for your program
    and that you also wanted to import a module with the same name
    from Python's standard library.
    If so, you should use a different name for your program.

        You have a circular import.
        
    An `ImportError` exception indicates that a certain object could not
    be imported from a module or package. Most often, this is
    because the name of the object is not spelled correctly.
    
    The object that could not be imported is `a`.
    The module or package where it was 
    expected to be found is `circular_a`.
    
    The problem was likely caused by what is known as a 'circular import'.
    First, Python imported and started executing the code in file
       'TESTS:\runtime\test_import_error.py'.
    which imports module `circular_a`.
    During this process, the code in another file,
       'TESTS:\circular_b.py'
    was executed. However in this last file, an attempt was made
    to import the original module `circular_a`
    a second time, before Python had completed the first import.

    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'alpha3' referenced before assignment
    
        Did you mean `alpha2`?
        
    In Python, variables that are used inside a function are known as 
    local variables. Before they are used, they must be assigned a value.
    A variable that is used before it is assigned a value is assumed to
    be defined outside that function; it is known as a `global`
    (or sometimes `nonlocal`) variable. You cannot assign a value to such
    a global variable inside a function without first indicating to
    Python that this is a global variable, otherwise you will see
    an `UnboundLocalError`.
    
    Instead of writing `alpha3`, perhaps you meant one of the following:
    *   Local scope: `alpha2`, `alpha1`
