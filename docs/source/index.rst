**friendly** helps users understand what caused a given
exception in their Python program, and how to fix it.

There exists many Python projects
whose **primary** goal is to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for **advanced** programmers.
To my knowledge, of all those projects, friendly is the only one
designed with beginners in mind.

.. sidebar:: Using screenshots

    In this documentation, I most often use some screenshots,
    as I believe that they are more easily understandable by most users.
    Occasionally, I write some examples as text so that they
    can provide the required information to people relying on screen readers.
    If you rely on screen readers and need help because the use of screenshots
    prevents you from understanding the explanations, please do not hesitate to
    reach out to me: andre.roberge@gmail.com


To be more specific, while **friendly**
can be useful for advanced programmers,
it strives to present the information in a way that is easily
understood by beginners and/or by users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
**friendly** can give more detailed information as to
**where** an exception occurred, **what** a given exception means and
**why** it might have occurred (sometimes adding suggestions as to how to fix it.)

Even though **friendly** can be used on its own with a specially
designed console, a better option might be to use it together with
GUI-based editors/IDE including JupyterLab and Jupyter notebooks.
I explain how to do so later.
For now, I'll just show one quick example.


A quick look
------------

Consider the following program::

    # example.py
    def get_last(seq):
        last_index = len(seq)
        return seq[last_index]

    print(get_last([1, 2, 3]))

First, here is what happens when I use Python
to run this program.

Not exactly the most helpful information for beginners ...

Here's the corresponding version with full explanation from friendly,
making use of
`Rich <https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich>`_ to produce a colourful output.

One unique feature of friendly is that all the information
it provides can be translated into another language; currently, only
English (by default) and French are available but other languages
could easily be added.
