**Friendly tracebacks** - Simplified Python tracebacks translatable into
any language.

`Code on Github <https://github.com/aroberge/friendly-traceback>`_

.. warning::

    This is alpha software, currently in development. This documentation
    is almost certainly not up to date, but it should be enough to get
    you started.


In a nutshell
--------------

There exists many Python projects intended to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for advanced programmers.

Friendly-traceback is **not** one of these projects.

Friendly-traceback is aimed primarily at **beginners** and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.

Please, see the Design section for a complete description of the goals of this project.
