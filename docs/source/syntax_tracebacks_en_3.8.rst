Friendly SyntaxError tracebacks - in English
=============================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
This file contains only examples of SyntaxError.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_syntax_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_trb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.

SyntaxError - Assign to keyword
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error1.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """ Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: def = 2
              ^

    My best guess:
        You were trying to assign a value to the Python keyword 'def'.
        This is not allowed.
        
        

SyntaxError - Missing colon 1
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error2.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: if True
                 ^

    My best guess:
        You wrote a statement beginning with
        'if' but forgot to add a colon ':' at the end
        
        

SyntaxError - Missing colon 2
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error3.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: while True  # a comment
                      ^

    My best guess:
        You wrote a 'while' loop but
        forgot to add a colon ':' at the end
        
        

SyntaxError - elif, not else if
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error4.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       2: 
       3: if False:
       4:     pass
    -->5: else if True:
               ^

    My best guess:
        You meant to use Python's 'elif' keyword
        but wrote 'else if' instead
        
        

SyntaxError - elif, not elseif
------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error5.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       2: 
       3: if False:
       4:     pass
    -->5: elseif True:
                 ^

    My best guess:
        You meant to use Python's 'elif' keyword
        but wrote 'elseif' instead
        
        

SyntaxError - malformed def statment - 1
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error6.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: def :
              ^

    My best guess:
        You tried to define a function or method
        and did not use the correct syntax.
        The correct syntax is:
            def name ( optional_arguments ):
        

SyntaxError - malformed def statment - 2
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error7.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: def name  :
                    ^

    My best guess:
        You tried to define a function or method
        and did not use the correct syntax.
        The correct syntax is:
            def name ( optional_arguments ):
        

SyntaxError - malformed def statment - 3
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error8.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: def ( arg )  :
              ^

    My best guess:
        You tried to define a function or method
        and did not use the correct syntax.
        The correct syntax is:
            def name ( optional_arguments ):
        

SyntaxError - can't assign to literal
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error9.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: can't assign to literal"""
       2: 
    -->3: 1 = a
          ^

    My best guess:
        You wrote an expression like
            1 = a
        where <1>, on the left hand-side of the equal sign, is
        an actual number or string (what Python calls a 'literal'),
        and not the name of a variable. Perhaps you meant to write:
            a = 1
        
        

SyntaxError - import X from Y
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error10.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: invalid syntax"""
       2: 
    -->3: import pen from turtle
                     ^

    My best guess:
        You wrote something like
            import pen from turtle
        instead of
            from turtle import pen
        
        

SyntaxError - EOL while scanning string literal
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error11.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal"""
       2: 
    -->3: alphabet = 'abc
                         ^

    My best guess:
        You starting writing a string with a single or double quote
        but never ended the string with another quote on that line.
        

SyntaxError - assignment to keyword (None)
------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: cannot assign to None
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error12.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: cannot assign to None in Py 3.8
       2:    and can't assign to keyword before."""
       3: 
    -->4: None = 1
          ^

    My best guess:
        None is a constant in Python; you cannot assign it a value.
        
        

SyntaxError - assignment to keyword (__debug__)
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: cannot assign to __debug__
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error13.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: cannot assign to __debug__ in Py 3.8
       2:    and assignment to keyword before."""
       3: 
    -->4: __debug__ = 1
          ^

    My best guess:
        __debug__ is a constant in Python; you cannot assign it a value.
        
        

SyntaxError - unmatched closing parenthesis
-------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: unmatched ')'
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error14.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       3: """
       4: a = (1,
       5:     2,
    -->6:     3, 4,))
                    ^

    My best guess:
        The closing parenthesis ')' on line 6 does not match anything.
        

SyntaxError - unclosed parenthesis
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error15.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: invalid syntax"""
       2: x = int('1'
    -->3: if x == 1:
                   ^

    My best guess:
        The opening parenthesis '(' on line 2 is not closed.
        

SyntaxError - mismatched brackets
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: closing parenthesis ']' does not match opening parenthesis '('
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error16.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: invalid syntax"""
    -->2: x = (1, 2, 3]
                      ^

    My best guess:
        The closing square bracket ']' on line 2 does not match the opening parenthesis '(' on line 2.
