Friendly SyntaxError tracebacks - in English
=============================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
This file contains only examples of SyntaxError.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_syntax_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_trb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.

SyntaxError - Assign to keyword
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error1.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """ Should raise SyntaxError"""
       2: 
    -->3: def = 2
              ^

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        You were trying to assign a value to the Python keyword 'def'.
        This is not allowed.

        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        You wrote a statement beginning with
        'if' but forgot to add a colon ':' at the end
        
        

SyntaxError - Missing colon 2
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax

                      ^

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        You wrote a 'while' loop but
        forgot to add a colon ':' at the end
        
        

SyntaxError - elif, not else if
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: none

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        You meant to use Python's 'elif' keyword
        but wrote 'else if' instead

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        You tried to define a function or method
        and did not use the correct syntax.
        The correct syntax is:
            def name ( optional_arguments ):
        

SyntaxError - malformed def statment - 2
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:

SyntaxError - can't assign to literal
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: can't assign to literal"""
       2: 
    -->3: 1 = a
          ^

    My best guess:
        You wrote an expression like
            1 = a
        where <1>, on the left hand-side of the equal sign, is
        or includes an actual number or string (what Python calls a 'literal'),
        and not the name of a variable. Perhaps you meant to write:
            a = 1

       2: 
    -->3: 1 = 2

    My best guess:
        You wrote an expression like

        and not the name of a variable.
        

SyntaxError - import X from Y
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error10.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: invalid syntax"""
       2: 
    -->3: import pen from turtle
                     ^

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        You wrote something like
            import pen from turtle
        instead of
            from turtle import pen
        
        

SyntaxError - EOL while scanning string literal
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:

       2: 
    -->3: alphabet = 'abc
                         ^

    My best guess:
        You starting writing a string with a single or double quote
        but never ended the string with another quote on that line.
        

SyntaxError - assignment to keyword (None)
------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: cannot assign to None
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error12.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.

       2:    and can't assign to keyword before."""
       3: 
    -->4: None = 1

    My best guess:
        None is a constant in Python; you cannot assign it a value.
        
        

SyntaxError - assignment to keyword (__debug__)
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: cannot assign to __debug__
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

       2:    and assignment to keyword before."""
       3: 
    -->4: __debug__ = 1
          ^

    My best guess:
        __debug__ is a constant in Python; you cannot assign it a value.
        
        

SyntaxError - unmatched closing parenthesis
-------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: unmatched ')'
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

       5:     2,
    -->6:     3, 4,))

    My best guess:
        The closing parenthesis ')' on line 6 does not match anything.
        

SyntaxError - unclosed parenthesis
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.

SyntaxError - unclosed parenthesis - 2
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: invalid syntax"""
    -->2: x = (1, 2, 3]
                      ^

    My best guess:
        Python gave us the following informative message
        about the possible cause of the error:
        
            closing parenthesis ']' does not match opening parenthesis '('
        
        However, I do not recognize this information and I have
        to guess what went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.

SyntaxError - mismatched brackets - 2
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: closing parenthesis ']' does not match opening parenthesis '(' on line 2
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error16a.py'

        about the possible cause of the error:
        
            closing parenthesis ']' does not match opening parenthesis '(' on line 2

SyntaxError - print is a function
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello')?
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print' ..."""
    -->2: print 'hello'
                ^

    My best guess:
        Perhaps you need to type print('hello')?
        
        In older version of Python, 'print' was a keyword.
        Now, 'print' is a function; you need to use parentheses to call it.
        

SyntaxError - Python keyword as function name

    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error18.py'

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        You tried to use the Python keyword 'pass' as a function name.
        

SyntaxError - break outside loop
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: 'break' outside loop
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

       2: 
       3: if True:
    -->4:     break
              ^

    My best guess:
        The Python keyword 'break' can only be used inside a for loop or inside a while loop.
        

SyntaxError - continue outside loop
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: 'continue' not properly in loop
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

    My best guess:
        The Python keyword 'continue' can only be used inside a for loop or inside a while loop.
        

SyntaxError - quote inside a string
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error21.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: invalid syntax"""
       2: 
    -->3: message = 'don't'
                         ^

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        There appears to be a Python identifier (variable name)
        immediately following a string.
        I suspect that you were trying to use a quote inside a string
        that was enclosed in quotes of the same kind.
        

SyntaxError - missing comma in a dict
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not parse the file 'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error22.py'

       4:      'b': 2
    -->5:      'c': 3,
               ^

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        It is possible that you forgot a comma between items in a set or dict
        before the position indicated by --> and ^.
        

SyntaxError - missing comma in a set

    My best guess:
        In Python, you can define functions with only positional arguments
        
            def test(a, b, c): ...

        In Python, you can call functions with only positional arguments
        
            test(1, 2, 3)
        
        or only keyword arguments

    My best guess:
        Inside an f-string, which is a string prefixed by the letter f, 
        you have another string, which starts with either a
        single quote (') or double quote ("), without a matching closing one.

    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

        5:     return [1, 2, 3,
        6: 
        7: print(foo())

    My best guess:
        Python gave us the following informative message
        about the possible cause of the error:
        
            unexpected EOF while parsing
        
        However, I do not recognize this information and I have
        to guess what went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.

       4: 
       5: def f(x):
    -->6:     global x
              ^

    My best guess:
        You are including the statement
        
                global x
        
        indicating that 'x' is a variable defined outside a function.
        You are also using the same 'x' as an argument for that
        function, thus indicating that it should be variable known only
        inside that function, which is the contrary of what 'global' implied.

    My best guess:
        Python did not give us much information regarding
        the cause of the error. I make an effort below to guess what
        went wrong, but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        You cannot use the Python keyword pass as an attribute.
