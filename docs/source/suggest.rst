===================

The more cases friendly will include, the more useful
it will be.
If you have used friendly and come accross a situation
where it either did not know how to deal with a given exception type,
or could not provide an appropriate explanation, please
`file an issue <https://github.com/aroberge/friendly/issues>`_.

Ideally, you should include the code sample that give rise to that
exception and an explanation that would be understandable by
beginners and helpful to them to understand what that exception means.
Please include which version of Python and friendly you are
using.
