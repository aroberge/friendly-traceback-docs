Friendly SyntaxError tracebacks - in English
=============================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
This file contains only examples of SyntaxError and its sub-classes.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_syntax_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_trb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.2.92
Python version: 3.7.8



Using 'and' in import statement

    The Python keyword `and` can only be used for boolean expressions.
    Perhaps you meant to write
    
    `from math import sin , cos`

Incorrect use of 'from module import ... as ...

    I am guessing that you are trying to import at least one object
    from module `math` and rename it using the Python keyword `as`;
    this keyword can only be used to rename one object at a time
    using a well defined syntax.
    I suggest that you split up any such import statement with each object
    renamed on a separate line as follows:
    
        from math import object_1 as name_1
        from math import object_2 as name_2  # if needed

    I am guessing that you were writing a comprehension or a generator expression
    and forgot to include parentheses around tuples.
    As an example, instead of writing
    
        [i, i**2 for i in range(10)]
    
    you would need to write
    
        [(i, i**2) for i in range(10)]

    I am guessing that you were writing a comprehension or a generator expression

    The correct order depends if there is an `else` clause or not.
    For example, the correct order for a list comprehensions with
    condition can be either
    
        [f(x) if condition else other for x in sequence]  # 'if' before 'for'
    
    or, if there is no `else`

    You have written an f-string whose content `{...}`
    includes a backslash; this is not allowed.
    Perhaps you can replace the part that contains a backslash by
    some variable. For example, suppose that you have an f-string like:
    
        f"{... 'hello\n' ...}"
    
    you could write this as
    
        hello = 'hello\n'
        f"{... hello ...}"
