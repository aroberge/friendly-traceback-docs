Comparison between Python versions: SyntaxErrors
================================================

In this file, we highlight differences between the information
given by different versions of Python when it comes to ``SyntaxError``.
The content of this file is likely of no use to anyone except for
people who write code to include new ``SyntaxError`` cases.

The differences between Python versions can be:

1. The error message itself.
2. The location of the error as indicated by Python with ``^``. We've decided to leave these out for now.

As a consequence, the information as to what we guess is the
cause can be slightly different.  So, we also show when we
assign a different cause.

Note that the content below is extracted automaticaly by
a simple program we wrote for this purpose.
If the information is the same for Python 3.6 and
3.7, but changes for Python 3.8, we only show the differences
between 3.7 and 3.8.
