    If you already know how to run Python programs from a terminal/command line,
    and know what is meant by a "REPL", you should go directly to the
    next page.


What is a REPL?
---------------

A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive mode where
we are invited to type in some Python code after
**prompt** (most often written as ``>>>``). Python reads
this code, interprets what it means, and might "print" (show) some
result before showing another prompt waiting for us to enter
more code.

Other synonyms of REPL are "console", "shell", "interpreter".
