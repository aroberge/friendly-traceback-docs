Useful information for beginners
=================================

.. tip::

    If you already know how to run Python programs from a terminal/command line,
    and know what is meant by a "REPL", you should go directly to the
    next page.


The information in this page is not intended to take the place of a
complete introduction for beginners.


What is a REPL?
---------------

A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive mode where
we are invited to type in some Python code after
**prompt** (most often written as ``>>>``). Python reads
this code, interprets what it means, and might "print" (show) some
result before showing another prompt waiting for us to enter
more code.

Other synonyms of REPL are "console", "shell", and "interpreter".

In the image shown above, I have started a python interpreter
using the command ``python``, and entered the code
``print('Hello world!')`` at the prompt.

The ``python`` command refers to whatever you need to type to invoke your
favourite Python interpreter in a terminal on your computer.
It could be ``python``, ``python3``, ``py -3.8``, etc.


How to run a Python program
----------------------------

Instead of using an interpreter to type code when prompted
by Python, you can use an editor, save your program in
a file (named ``hello.py`` in my example) and run
it in a terminal by using the command
``python hello.py``.

Another option is to use a program like IDLE which includes
both an editor and a python interpreter.

There exists many other editors designed to be used
by Python programmers.
For example, some of you might be familiar with Mu:

Summary
-------

You can run Python programs by typing ``python ...`` in a terminal
or by using and editor with a built-in menu for running Python programs.

In the early part of this documentation, the examples I will use
will be mostly done using ``python ...`` in a terminal.
Even if this is not the way that you normally run Python programs,
it would be most helpful if you tried to follow along by doing
something similar to what I show.
