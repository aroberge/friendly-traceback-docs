Everything about the friendly console
=======================================


.. note::

    The hand-written documentation about the console
    might not reflect the latest version of the code.
    This page documents the relevant API by automatically
    extracting information from the code.

    Note that ``dark()`` and ``light()`` might not be
    available in some environments (for example, when using
    IDLE or Mu.)
