==========

Sometimes, it might make sense to show all the available information at
once. This is what ``explain()`` does. Let's illustrate it with
a screen capture.

``explain()`` shows everything: a friendly traceback with an
added ``hint()``, as well as the output of
``what()``, ``where()`` and ``why()``.
