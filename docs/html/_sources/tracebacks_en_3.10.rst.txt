Friendly tracebacks - in English
======================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Below, we can find some examples. SyntaxError cases, as well as TabError and
IndentationError cases, are shown in a separate page.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by Friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     C:\Users\andre\github\Friendly-traceback\tests\trb_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.1.6a
Python version: 3.10.0a1

    ArithmeticError: 
    
    `ArithmeticError` is the base class for those built-in exceptions
    that are raised for various arithmetic errors.
    It is unusual that you are seeing this exception;
    normally, a more specific exception should have been raised.
    
    Exception raised on line 9 of file 'TESTS:\runtime\test_arithmetic_error.py'.

        Did you mean `pi`?
        
    An `ImportError` exception indicates that a certain object could not

    LookupError: Fake message
    
    `LookupError` is the base class for the exceptions that are raised
    when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid.
    It can also be raised directly by codecs.lookup().
    
    Exception raised on line 10 of file 'TESTS:\runtime\test_lookup_error.py'.

    An `IndexError` occurs when you are try to get an item from a list,
    a tuple, or a similar object (sequence), by using an index which

    A `ModuleNotFoundError` exception indicates that you
    are trying to import a module that cannot be found by Python.
    This could be because you misspelled the name of the module
    or because it is not installed on your computer.
    
        The name of the module that could not be imported is `Tkinter`.
        `tkinter` is an existing module that has a similar name.

    NameError: name 'something' is not defined
    
    A `NameError` exception indicates that a variable or
    function name is not known to Python.
    Most often, this is because there is a spelling mistake.
    However, sometimes it is because the name is used
    before being defined or given a value.
