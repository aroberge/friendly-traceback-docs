**Friendly tracebacks** - Simplified Python tracebacks translatable into
any language.

`Code on Github <https://github.com/aroberge/friendly-traceback>`_

.. warning::

    This is pre-alpha software, currently in development. We're focusing
    on breadth of coverage (i.e. the number of Exceptions explained in
    simple language) over quality of code and its documentation.
    However, everything included should work.

More info to be added soon.  But, please, see the Design section
for a description of the goal of this project, in particular, the
section on "Verbosity".
