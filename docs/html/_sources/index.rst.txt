**Friendly tracebacks** - Simplified Python tracebacks translatable into
any language.

`Code on Github <https://github.com/aroberge/friendly-traceback>`_

.. warning::

    This is alpha software, currently in development. This documentation
    is almost certainly not up to date, but it should be enough to get
    you started.


In a nutshell
--------------

There exists many Python projects intended to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for advanced programmers.
Friendly-traceback is **not** one of these projects.

Friendly-traceback is aimed primarily at **beginners** and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
Please, see the Design section for a complete description of the goals
of this project.

About the version
-----------------

Typically, the version shown at the top will have the letter "a" at the end.
This means that the latest version available from Pypi is the version number
without the "a", and that we are working towards the next release, so that
some features may be slightly different from the version available from Pypi.
