Why all the tracebacks?
=========================

This documentation contains essentially all the tracebacks
generated from unit tests, for all Python versions. We do this for
two reasons. First, so that interested users can browse through and
perhaps find cases where the explanation provided could be improved.
Secondly, these traceback capture more information than what
we check in the unit tests. In this way, when we run all tests,
we can use something like "git diff" to see if any unexpected changes
occur.
