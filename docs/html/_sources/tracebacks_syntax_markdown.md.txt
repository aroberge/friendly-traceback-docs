## IndentationError: expected an indented block


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error1.py", line 4
    pass
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block

```

An `IndentationError` occurs when a given line of code is
not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error1.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: '''Should raise IndentationError'''
       2: 
       3: if True:
    -->4: pass
          ^

```

The line identified above
was expected to begin a new indented block.

       3:     pass
    -->4:       pass
               ^

```

The line identified above is more indented than expected.

---

## IndentationError: unindent does not match ...


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error3.py", line 5
    pass
        ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level

```

An `IndentationError` occurs when a given line of code is
not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error3.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: '''Should raise IndentationError'''
       2: 
       3: if True:
       4:       pass
    -->5:     pass
                  ^

```

The line identified above is less indented than expected.

## IndentationError: missing continuation line


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error4.py", line 6
    "c"
   ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent

```

not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error4.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       2: 
       3: def f():
       4:      s = "a"\
       5:          "b"
    -->6:          "c"
                  ^

```

The line identified above is more indented than expected.

However, line 6, which is identified as having a problem,
consists of a single string which is also the case
for the preceding line.
Perhaps you meant to include a continuation character, `\`,
at the end of line 5.

## TabError


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_tab_error.py", line 7
    pass
        ^
TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation

```

A `TabError` indicates that you have used both spaces
and tab characters to indent your code.
This is not allowed in Python.
Indenting your code means to have block of codes aligned vertically
by inserting either spaces or tab characters at the beginning of lines.
Python's recommendation is to always use spaces to indent your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_tab_error.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       3: 
       4:

There appears to be a Python identifier (variable name)
immediately following a string.
I suspect that you were trying to use a quote inside a string
that was enclosed in quotes of the same kind.

               ^
       6:      }

```

Python indicates that the error is caused by `'c'` written immediately after `2`.
It is possible that you forgot a comma between items in a set or dict
before the position indicated by --> and ^.
Perhaps you meant

    a = {'a': 1,     'b': 2,     'c': 3,     }

```

Python indicates that the error is caused by `3` written immediately after `2`.
It is possible that you forgot a comma between items in a set or dict
before the position indicated by --> and ^.
Perhaps you meant to insert an operator like `+, -, *`
between `2` and `3`.
The following lines of code would not cause any `SyntaxError`:

    a = {1, 2,  3}
    a = {1, 2 +  3}
    a = {1, 2 -  3}
    a = {1, 2 *  3}

Inside the f-string `f"Bob is {age['Bob]} years old."`, 
you have another string, which starts with either a
single quote (') or double quote ("), without a matching closing one.

Python tells us that it reached the end of the file

```

You are including the statement

        global x


indicating that `x` is a variable defined outside a function.
You are also using the same `x` as an argument for that
function, thus indicating that it should be variable known only
inside that function, which is the contrary of what `global` implied.

You are using the continuation character `\` outside of a string,
and it is followed by some other character(s).
I am guessing that you forgot to enclose some content in a string.

       5: 
       6: 
    -->7: a = dict('key'=1)
                   ^

```

One of the following two possibilities could be the cause:
1. You meant to do a comparison with == and wrote = instead.
2. You called a function with a named argument:

       a_function(invalid=something)

where `invalid` is not a valid variable name in Python
either because it starts with a number, or is a string,
or contains a period, etc.

You used `x` as a parameter for a function
before declaring it also as a nonlocal variable:
`x` cannot be both at the same time.

---

## Name is global and nonlocal

       5: 
       6: def f():
    -->7:     global xy
              ^

```

You declared `xy` as being both a global and nonlocal variable.
A variable can be global, or nonlocal, but not both at the same time.

  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error72.py", line 6
    f'{x}' = 42
    ^
SyntaxError: cannot assign to f-string expression

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error72.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: """Should raise
       2: Python < 3.8: SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
       3: Python >= 3.8: SyntaxError: cannot assign to f-string expression
       4: """
       5: 
    -->6: f'{x}' = 42
          ^

```

You wrote an expression that has the f-string `f'{x}'`
on the left-hand side of the equal sign.
An f-string should only appear on the right-hand side of an equal sign.

       4: 
       5: L = range(10)
    -->6: f(x for x in L, 1)
            ^

```

You are using a generator expression, something of the form
    `x for x in thing`
You must add parentheses enclosing that expression.

## Invalid character (bad quote)


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error75.py", line 3
    a = « hello »
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier

```

Did you mean to use a normal quote character, `'` or `"`?



A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error75.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier for Python <=3.8
       2:    and  SyntaxError: invalid character '«' (U+00AB) in Python 3.9"""
    -->3: a = « hello »
              ^

```

Did you use copy-paste?
Python indicates that you used the unicode character `«`
which is not allowed.
I suspect that you used a fancy unicode quotation mark
instead of a normal single or double quote for a string.

Did you made a mistake in writing an hexadecimal integer?



A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file

       2: 
    -->3: a = 0x123g4
                   ^

```

It looks like you used an invalid character (`g`) in an hexadecimal number.

Hexadecimal numbers are base 16 integers that use the symbols `0` to `9`
to represent values 0 to 9, and the letters `a` to `f` (or `A` to `F`)
to represent values 10 to 15.
In Python, hexadecimal numbers start with either `0x` or `0X`,
followed by the characters used to represent the value of that integer.

       3: 
    -->4: a-b = 2
          ^

```

You wrote an expression that includes some mathematical operations
on the left-hand side of the equal sign which should be
only used to assign a value to a variable.
Perhaps you meant to write `a_b` instead of `a-b`

       1: """Should raise SyntaxError: can't use starred expression here"""
       2: 
    -->3: *a
          ^

```

The star operator `*` is interpreted to mean that
iterable unpacking is to be used to assign a name
to each item of an iterable, which does not make sense here.

---

## Cannot use double star operator


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks

Python could not understand the code in the file
'<fstring>'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
    -->1: (**k)
           ^

```

The double star operator `**` is likely interpreted to mean that
dict unpacking is to be used which does not make sense here.

---

## Cannot use return outside function

  File "None", line None
SyntaxError: too many statically nested blocks

Seriously?



A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


You cannot be serious!

```python
       1: # SyntaxError: named arguments must follow bare *
       2: 
       3: 
    -->4: def f(*):
                ^

```

Assuming you were defining a function, you need
to replace `*` by either `*arguments` or
by `*, named_argument=value`.

---

## use j instead of i


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks

Did you mean `3.0j`?



A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error89.py'

```python
       1: # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
       2: 
    -->3: a = 3.0i
                 ^

```

Valid names cannot begin with a number.
Perhaps you thought that `i` could be used to represent
the square root of `-1`. In Python, the symbol used for this is `j`
and the complex part is written as `some_number` immediately
followed by `j`, with no spaces in between.
Perhaps you meant to write `3.0j`.

When using a `from __future__ import` statement,
you must import specific named features.

The available features are `nested_scopes, generators, division, absolute_import, with_statement, print_function, unicode_literals, barry_as_FLUFL, generator_stop, annotations`.

'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error93.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
    -->1: from __future__ import braces
          ^

```

I suspect you wrote `from __future__ import braces` following
someone else's suggestion. This will never work.

Unlike other programming languages, Python's code block are defined by
their indentation level, and not by using some curly braces, like `{...}`.

A `from __future__ import` statement changes the way Python
interprets the code in a file.
It must appear at the beginning of the file.

Did you made a mistake in writing an octal integer?



A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file

       1: 
       2: 
    -->3: b = 0O1876
                 ^

```

It looks like you used an invalid character (`8`) in an octal number.

Octal numbers are base 8 integers that only use the symbols `0` to `7`
to represent values.
In Python, hexadecimal numbers start with either `0o` or `0O`,
(the digit zero followed by the letter `o`)
followed by the characters used to represent the value of that integer.

```python
       1: 
       2: 
    -->3: def "function"():
              ^

```

The name of a function must be a valid Python identifier,
that is a name that begins with a letter or an underscore character, `_`,
and which contains only letters, digits or the underscore character.
You attempted to use a string as a function name.

```python
       1: 
       2: 
    -->3: x = y === z
                  ^

```

You wrote three equal signs in a row which is allowed in some
programming languages, but not in Python. To check if two objects
are equal, use two equal signs, `==`; to see if two names represent
the exact same object, use the operator `is`.

---

    -->3: if var start := begin < end:
                 ^

```

Perhaps you forgot that you cannot have spaces
in variable names and wrote `'var start'`
instead of `'var_start'`.

## Using 'and' in import statement


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error100.py", line 1
    from math import sin and cos
                         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error100.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
    -->1: from math import sin and cos
                               ^

```

The Python keyword `and` can only be used for boolean expressions.
Perhaps you meant to write

`from math import sin , cos`

## Annotated name cannot be global


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error101.py", line 4
    x:int = 1
    ^
SyntaxError: annotated name 'x' can't be global

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error101.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: # SyntaxError: annotated name 'x' can't be global
       2: def foo():
       3:     global x
    -->4:     x:int = 1
              ^

```

The object named `x` is defined with type annotation
as a local variable. It cannot be declared to be a global variable.

---

## Two consecutive names


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error102.py", line 5
    var start := begin < end
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

Did you mean `'var_start'`?



A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error102.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       2: end = 4
       3: 
       4: if (
    -->5:     var start := begin < end
                  ^
       6:    ):

```

Python indicates that the error is caused by `start` written immediately after `var`.
It is possible that you forgot a comma between items in a tuple, 
or between function arguments, 
before the position indicated by --> and ^.
Perhaps you meant

    if (    var, start := begin < end   ):
Perhaps you forgot that you cannot have spaces
in variable names and wrote `'var start'`
instead of `'var_start'`.

## Deleting constant/keyword


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error103.py", line 1
    del True
        ^
SyntaxError: cannot delete True

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error103.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
    -->1: del True
              ^

```

You cannot delete the constant `True`.

---

## Deleting literal


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error104.py", line 1
    del "Hello world!"
        ^
SyntaxError: cannot delete literal

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error104.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
    -->1: del "Hello world!"
              ^

```

You cannot delete the literal `"Hello world!"`.
You can only delete the names of objects, or
individual items in a container.

## EOL unescaped backslash


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error105.py", line 1
    a = "abc\"
              ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

```

Did you forget to escape a backslash character?



A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error105.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
    -->1: a = "abc\"
                    ^

```

You starting writing a string with a single or double quote
but never ended the string with another quote on that line.
Perhaps you meant to write the backslash character, `\`
as the last character in the string and forgot that you
needed to escape it by writing two `\` in a row.

---

## f-string with backslash


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error106.py", line 2
    print(f"{'\n'.join(names)}")
          ^
SyntaxError: f-string expression part cannot include a backslash

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error106.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: names = ['a', 'b']
    -->2: print(f"{'\n'.join(names)}")
                ^

```

You have written an f-string whose content `{...}`
includes a backslash; this is not allowed.
Perhaps you can replace the part that contains a backslash by
some variable. For example, suppose that you have an f-string like:

    f"{... 'hello\n' ...}"

you could write this as

    hello = 'hello\n'
    f"{... hello ...}"

---

## Unterminated triple quoted string


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error107.py", line 4
    some_text = """In a land
populated by weird animals,

                                                               ^
SyntaxError: EOF while scanning triple-quoted string literal

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error107.py'
for an unspecified reason.


```python
       1: some_text =

```

You started writing a triple-quoted string but never wrote
the triple quotes needed to end the string.

---

## Incorrect use of 'from module import ... as ...


```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 42, in create_tracebacks
    mod = __import__(name)
  File "TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error108.py", line 2
    from math import (sin, cos) as funcs
                                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.


Python could not understand the code in the file
'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error108.py'
beyond the location indicated by --> and ^.


```python
       1: # issue 158
    -->2: from math import (sin, cos) as funcs
                                      ^

```

I am guessing that you are trying to import at least one object
from module `math` and rename it using the Python keyword `as`;
this keyword can only be used to rename one object at a time
using a well defined syntax.
I suggest that you split up any such import statement with each object
renamed on a separate line as follows:

    from math import object_1 as name_1
    from math import object_2 as name_2  # if needed
