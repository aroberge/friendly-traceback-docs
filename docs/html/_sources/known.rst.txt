Generic information about various exceptions
==============================================

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     what.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

This file contains the generic information provided by
Friendly-traceback about built-in exceptions.
By "generic information" we mean the information provided using
``what()`` in a friendly console.

Some exceptions will never be seen by users of Friendly-traceback.

For example, ``SystemExit`` and ``KeyboardInterrupt`` are never
intercepted by Friendly-traceback. Furthermore, exceptions such as
``GeneratorExit``, ``FloatingPointError``, and
``StopAsyncIteration``, would likely never be seen.

``FloatingPointError`` is actually
`not used by Python <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/exceptions.html#FloatingPointError>`_.

``BaseException``, ``Exception``, and ``ArithmeticError`` are base classes which
are also not normally seen: some derived classes are normally used instead.

Information compiled using Friendly version: 0.3.36,
Python version: 3.8.4

    and tab characters to indent your code.
    This is not allowed in Python.
    Indenting your code means to have block of codes aligned vertically

TypeError
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    A `TypeError` is usually caused by trying

    by calling a function with the wrong type of object,
    or by trying to do an operation not allowed on a given type of object.

UnboundLocalError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    In Python, variables that are used inside a function are known as 
    local variables. Before they are used, they must be assigned a value.
    A variable that is used before it is assigned a value is assumed to
    be defined outside that function; it is known as a `global`
    (or sometimes `nonlocal`) variable. You cannot assign a value to such
    a global variable inside a function without first indicating to
    Python that this is a global variable, otherwise you will see
    an `UnboundLocalError`.
