Generic information about various exceptions
==============================================

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     what.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.

This file contains the generic information provided by
Friendly-traceback about built-in exceptions.
By "generic information" we mean the information provided using
``what()`` in a friendly console.

Some exceptions will never be seen by users of Friendly-traceback.

For exemple, ``SystemExit`` and ``KeyboardInterrupt`` are never
intercepted by Friendly-traceback. Furthermore, exceptions such as
``GeneratorExit``, ``StopIteration``, ``FloatingPointError``, and
``StopAsyncIteration``, would likely never be seen.

In the case of ``StopIteration``, see
`PEP 479 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/>`_.

``FloatingPointError`` is actually
`not used by Python <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/exceptions.html#FloatingPointError>`_.

``BaseException``, ``Exception``, and ``ArithmeticError`` are base classes which
are also not normally seen: some derived classes are normally used instead.

Information compiled using Friendly-traceback version: 0.2.12a,
Python version: 3.8.4
