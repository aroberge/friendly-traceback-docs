Friendly SyntaxError tracebacks - in English
=============================================

Friendly aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
This file contains only examples of SyntaxError and its sub-classes.
Some tests may appear to be repetitive to a human reader
but they are may be included to ensure more complete test coverage..

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_syntax_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_trb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.

Friendly version: 0.3.142
Python version: 3.6.8



(1) Using 'and' in import statement

    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    
    A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\and_in_import_statement.py'
    beyond the location indicated by ^.
    
    -->1: from math import sin and cos
                                 ^

    The Python keyword `and` can only be used for boolean expressions.
    Perhaps you meant to write
    
    `from math import sin , cos`

(3) Annotated name cannot be global

    The object named `x` is defined with type annotation
    as a local variable. It cannot be declared to be a global variable.
    

(4) Incorrect use of 'from module import ... as ...

    I am guessing that you are trying to import at least one object
    from module `math` and rename it using the Python keyword `as`;
    this keyword can only be used to rename one object at a time
    using a well defined syntax.
    I suggest that you split up any such import statement with each object
    renamed on a separate line as follows:
    
        from math import object_1 as name_1
        from math import object_2 as name_2  # if needed

    On the left-hand side of an equal sign, you have a
    conditional expression instead of the name of a variable.
    A conditional expression has the following form:
    
        variable = object if condition else other_object

    Hexadecimal numbers are base 16 integers that use the symbols `0` to `9`
    to represent values 0 to 9, and the letters `a` to `f` (or `A` to `F`)
    to represent values 10 to 15.

    followed by the characters used to represent the value of that integer.

    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    
        Did you made a mistake in writing an octal integer?
        
    A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\invalid_octal.py'
    beyond the location indicated by ^.
    
       1: 
       2: 
    -->3: b = 0O1876
                   ^

    It looks like you used an invalid character (`8`) in an octal number.
    
    Octal numbers are base 8 integers that only use the symbols `0` to `7`
    to represent values.
    In Python, hexadecimal numbers start with either `0o` or `0O`,
    (the digit zero followed by the letter `o`)
    followed by the characters used to represent the value of that integer.

    Python indicates that the error is caused by `b` written immediately after `a`.
    Perhaps you meant to insert an operator like `+; -; *; ,`
    between `a` and `b`.
    The following lines of code would not cause any `SyntaxError`:
    
        python = a + b
        python = a - b
        python = a * b
        python = a, b
    Note: these are just some of the possible choices and that
    some of them might raise other types of exceptions.

    Perhaps you wrote one of them by mistake
    or forgot to write something between them.
    Or perhaps you included a space by mistake between the two operators
    and meant to write `**` as a single operator.

        You forgot to add a condition.
        
    A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\while_missing_condition.py'
    beyond the location indicated by ^.
    
    -->1: while:
               ^

    A `while` loop requires a condition:
    
        while condition:
            ...

        The augmented assignment operator is not allowed in Python version 3.6.
        
    A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.

    You appear to be using the operator `:=`, sometimes called
    the walrus operator. This operator requires the use of
    Python 3.8 or newer. You are using version 3.6.
    

(196) Debug-feature of f-string not supported
---------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py", line 49, in create_tracebacks

    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    
        Your Python version does not support this f-string feature.
        
    A `SyntaxError` occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\<fstring>'

    You are likely using a 'debug' syntax of f-strings introduced
    in Python version 3.8. You are using version 3.6.

    You are likely trying to assign a value within an f-string.
    This is not allowed.
