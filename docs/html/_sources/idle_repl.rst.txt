IDLE's shell
============


.. admonition:: Summary

    friendly has a special mode for IDLE.
    It is strongly recommended to use the friendly console by
    using the following two instructions when beginning a session::

        from friendly.idle import *
        start_console()


As I mentioned previously, IDLE comes with its own repl
(also known as its "shell") which does
syntax coloring. By default, it uses blue for anything printed normally
(to stdout) and red for anything printed as part of an exception (to stderr).
When a SyntaxError is recognized, the location of that error is
highlighted, with red background.

You can use the friendly console within IDLE's shell as follows::

    from friendly.idle import start_console
    start_console()  # or start_console(lang="fr")

As you can see as pointed by (2) on the above image,
the prompt is in blue as it is "printed"by friendly
using the ``input()`` function.  

friendly's output within IDLE uses
three different colours which, in the default IDLE them
are as follow: black for Python code, red for anything else related
to a traceback, and blue for everything else. It also adopts
IDLE's feature of highlighting the location of an error using
a red background; however, unlike IDLE's itself, it does not do
so in the code entered previously, but only in its own output.


Latest IDLE version
-------------------

Starting with Python version 3.10.0a5, IDLE's shell allow the
use of customs ``sys.excepthook()`` to process runtime
errors (but not syntax errors). So, **instead of** starting
a friendly console using ``start_console()``, friendly can
be **installed** within IDLE's shell and provide information
for runtime errors. 
This time, instead of importing a single function,
"everything" must be imported, so that friendly's various functions,
such as ``why()`` shown below, can be used.

.. code-block:: python

    from friendly.idle import *
    install()

Note how the prompt is not blue as we are not using
friendly's own console.

Unfortunately, since syntax errors cannot (yet) be processed by friendly
in this mode, I do not recommend to use it in this way.

IDLE's developers are aware of this current limitation and might
provide in a future version a way for friendly to "hook" into IDLE's
mechanism for dealing with syntax errors.
