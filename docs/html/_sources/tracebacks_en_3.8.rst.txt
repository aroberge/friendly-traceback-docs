Friendly tracebacks - in English
======================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Below, we can find some examples. SyntaxError cases, as well as TabError and
IndentationError cases, are shown in a separate page.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_trb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.0.19a
Python version: 3.8.0



ArithmeticError
---------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        ArithmeticError: 
        
    ArithmeticError is the base class for those built-in exceptions
    that are raised for various arithmetic errors.
    It is unusual that you are seeing this exception;
    normally, a more specific exception should have been raised.

FileNotFoundError
-----------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'does_not_exist'
        
    A FileNotFoundError exception indicates that you
    are trying to open a file that cannot be found by Python.
    This could be because you misspelled the name of the file.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In your program, the name of the
        file that cannot be found is 'does_not_exist'.

ImportError
-----------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        ImportError: cannot import name 'Pi' from 'math' (unknown location)
        
    This exception indicates that a certain object could not
    be imported from a module or package. Most often, this is
    because the name of the object is not spelled correctly.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        The object that could not be imported is 'Pi'.
        The module or package where it was 
        expected to be found is 'math'.

KeyError
--------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        KeyError: 'c'
        
    A KeyError is raised when a value is not found as a
    key in a Python dict.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In your program, the name of the key
        that cannot be found is 'c'.

LookupError
-----------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        LookupError: 
        
    LookupError is the base class for the exceptions that are raised
    when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid.
    It can also be raised directly by codecs.lookup().
    
    Execution stopped on line 10 of file 'TESTS:\except\test_lookup_error.py'.

IndexError - short tuple
------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        IndexError: tuple index out of range
        
    An IndexError occurs when you are try to get an item from a list,
    a tuple, or a similar object (sequence), by using an index which
    does not exists; typically, this is because the index you give
    is greater than the length of the sequence.
    Reminder: the first item of a sequence is at index 0.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In this case, the sequence is a tuple.
        
    Execution stopped on line 8 of file 'TESTS:\except\test_index_error.py'.

    function name is not known to Python.
    Most often, this is because there is a spelling mistake.
    However, sometimes it is because the name is used

    (or sometimes 'nonlocal') variable. You cannot assign a value to such
    a global variable inside a function without first indicating to
    Python that this is a global variable, otherwise you will see
