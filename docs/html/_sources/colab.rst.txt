Google's colab
===============


One can also use Google Colab notebooks. However, the following should be noted:

1. friendly must be installed using ``!pip install friendly``.

2. As for Jupyter notebooks, ``from friendly.jupyter import *``
   must be used.

3. The colour support is not as good as is the case for Jupyter notebooks.

Here are some sample outputs:

.. image:: images/colab-jupyter.png
   :scale: 50 %

.. image:: images/colab-jupyter2.png
   :scale: 50 %

.. image:: images/colab-jupyter3.png
   :scale: 40 %

There is also a dark theme available.

.. image:: images/colab-dark1.png
   :scale: 50 %

Unfortunately, the default gives rise to some unreadable content.
Switching to using the ``'dark'`` formatter does improve the situation.

.. image:: images/colab-dark2.png
   :scale: 40 %

Specifying a background colour helps to blend in the result.

   :scale: 40 %
