Google's colab
===============


One can also use Google Colab notebooks. However, the following should be noted:

1. Friendly must be installed using ``!pip install friendly``.

2. As for Jupyter notebooks, ``from friendly.jupyter import *``
   must be used.

3. Rich **cannot** be used as a formatter.

Here is a sample output:
