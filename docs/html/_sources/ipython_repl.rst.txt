IPython's console
=================

Friendly can be used together with IPython when running
in a standard terminal. Unfortunately, I have not been able to
find a reliable way to use colours in this situation; as a result,
the default mode is perhaps not as readable as in other cases.

However, being able to integrate with IPython exception handling
means that Friendly can be used with Jupyter notebooks.
Furthermore, as was shown previously, it can also be used with
Mu's REPL which is a Jupyter console.
