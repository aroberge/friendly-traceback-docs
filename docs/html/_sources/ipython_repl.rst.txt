IPython's console
=================

Friendly can be used together with IPython when running
in a terminal, by using::

    from friendly.ipython import *

.. image:: images/ipython-console-repl.png
   :scale: 50 %

Being able to integrate with IPython exception handling
means that friendly can be used with Jupyter notebooks.
Furthermore, it can also be used with
Mu's REPL which is a Jupyter console based on IPython.
