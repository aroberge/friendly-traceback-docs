Friendly SyntaxError tracebacks - in English
=============================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
This file contains only examples of SyntaxError and its sub-classes.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     trb_syntax_english.py located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_trb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.

Friendly-traceback version: 0.0.20a
Python version: 3.8.0



IndentationError - 1: expected an indented block
------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        IndentationError: expected an indented block
        
    An IndentationError occurs when a given line of code is
    not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error1.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: '''Should raise IndentationError'''
       2: 
       3: if True:
    -->4: pass
          ^

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In this case, the line identified above
        was expected to begin a new indented block.
        

IndentationError - 2: unexpected indent
---------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        IndentationError: unexpected indent
        
    An IndentationError occurs when a given line of code is
    not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error2.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: '''Should raise IndentationError'''
       2: if True:
       3:     pass
    -->4:       pass
               ^

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In this case, the line identified above
        is more indented than expected and 
        does not match the indentation of the previous line.
        

IndentationError - 3: unindent does not match ...
-------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
        
    An IndentationError occurs when a given line of code is
    not indented (aligned vertically with other lines) as expected.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\raise_indentation_error3.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       1: '''Should raise IndentationError'''
       2: if True:
       3:       pass
    -->4:     pass
                  ^

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In this case, the line identified above is
        less indented than the preceding one,
        and is not aligned vertically with another block of code.
        

TabError
--------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
        
    A TabError indicates that you have used both spaces
    and tab characters to indent your code.
    This is not allowed in Python.
    Indenting your code means to have block of codes aligned vertically
    by inserting either spaces or tab characters at the beginning of lines.
    Python's recommendation is to always use spaces to indent your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\raise_tab_error.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
        4:

        indicating that 'x' is a variable defined outside a function.
        You are also using the same 'x' as an argument for that

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        One of the following two possibilities could be the cause:
        1. You meant to do a comparison with == and wrote = instead.

    I don't have enough information from Python:
        I make an effort below to guess what caused the problem
        but I might guess incorrectly.
        
        I am guessing that you tried to use the Python keyword
        None as an argument in the definition of a function.
        

SyntaxError - delete function call
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: cannot delete function call
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error47.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
       2: """
       3: 
       4: 
    -->5: del f(a)
              ^

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        You attempted to delete a function call
            del f(a)
        instead of deleting the function's name
            del f
        

SyntaxError - assigned prior to global declaration
--------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: name 'p' is assigned to before global declaration
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error48.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
        4: 
        5: def fn():
        6:     p = 1
    --> 7:     global p
               ^

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        You assigned a value to the variable 'p'
        before declaring it as a global variable.
        

SyntaxError - used prior to global declaration
----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: name 'r' is used prior to global declaration
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error49.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
        4: 
        5: def fn():
        6:     print(r)
    --> 7:     global r
               ^

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        You used the variable 'r'
        before declaring it as a global variable.
        

SyntaxError - assigned prior to nonlocal declaration
----------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'raise_syntax_error5-'
        
    A ModuleNotFoundError exception indicates that you
    are trying to import a module that cannot be found by Python.
    This could be because you misspelled the name of the module
    or because it is not installed on your computer.
    
    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        In your program, the name of the
        module that cannot be found is 'raise_syntax_error5-'.
        
    Execution stopped on line 102 of file 'TESTS:\trb_syntax_common.py'.
    
       100:                 make_title(title)

    -->102:                     mod = __import__(name)

    name: 'raise_syntax_error5-'

SyntaxError - used prior to nonlocal declaration
------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    Python exception:
        SyntaxError: name 's' is assigned to before nonlocal declaration
        
    A SyntaxError occurs when Python cannot understand your code.
    
    Python could not understand the code in the file
    'TESTS:\syntax\raise_syntax_error51.py'
    beyond the location indicated below by --> and ^.
    
        6: 
        7:     def g():
        8:         s = 2
    --> 9:         nonlocal s
                   ^

    Likely cause based on the information given by Python:
        You assigned a value to the variable 's'
        before declaring it as a nonlocal variable.
