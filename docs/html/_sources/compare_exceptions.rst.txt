Comparing Exception messages between Python versions
=====================================================

In this file, we highlight differences between the
messages provided by Python for all Exceptions excluding ``SyntaxError``
cases; these are covered elsewhere.

Note that the content below is extracted automaticaly by
a simple program we wrote for this purpose.
If the information is the same for Python 3.6 and
3.7, but changes for Python 3.8, and stays the same
afterwards, we only show the differences between 3.7 and 3.8.
