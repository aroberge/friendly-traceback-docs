why()
-------

You are a beginner reading some code found in a tutorial on the web
and decide to try it out by copy-pasting it.

So, this didn't work, but you'd like to find out why.


    >>> why()

    Python indicates that you used some unicode characters not allowed as part
    of a variable name; this includes many emojis. However, I suspect that you
    used a fancy unicode quotation mark instead of a normal single or double
    quote for a string. This can happen if you copy-pasted code.
