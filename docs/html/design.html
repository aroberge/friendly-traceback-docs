<p>The following are thoughts on the design of this project.
The content of this file <strong>will</strong> be changed as this project evolve.</p>
<div class="section" id="purpose">
<h2>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Friendly-traceback’s primary purpose is to make it easier for
beginners and/or for people that have limited knowledge of English
to understand what caused a program to generate a traceback.</p>
<p>A secondary goal is to help them learn how to decipher a normal Python
traceback and use the information <strong>provided by Python</strong>
to understand what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Thought …</p>
<p>The success of this module is predicated on contributions (mostly to
translations) by intermediate or advanced programmers.
For this reason, it might make sense to include some “advanced” features
that could be of interest to them, such as the example of
<strong>better-exceptions</strong> mentioned below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="semi-open-questions">
<h2>Semi-open questions<a class="headerlink" href="#semi-open-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Normally, an “open questions” section would be included at the end, but this document
is getting so long that few people might read it to the very end.
Furthermore, it might be useful to have these in mind while reading the rest of
this document. They are called “semi-open” as we have made explicit choices
about some of them, choices which could change given some feedback from
actual users.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In addition to showing the line of code where an exception is raised,
should we include other lines of code for contextual information and,
if so, how many?</p>
<p>Python’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgitb.html">cgitb module</a>
shows five lines of context for each “item” in a traceback. We currently
show at most three, ending with the line where the exception occurred.
(The screenshots below do not reflect the actual stage of the project.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Should we aim to provide information about <strong>all</strong> standard Python
Exceptions, or just a subset?  Some exceptions are going to occur only
because some really advanced features of Python are used (for example:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ConnectionRefusedError</span></code>) and it would be likely that users writing
such code are already experienced enough to not need supplementary help
from Friendly-traceback.</p></li>
<li><p>Should exceptions from specific modules in the standard library also
be included? As a specific example, perhaps exceptions raised in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turtle</span></code> module should be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>Should we include also Warnings?</p>
<p>The full list of exceptions and warnings is included in
<a class="reference internal" href="known.html#known"><span class="std std-ref">Known exceptions</span></a> as well as some notes about some Exceptions that have
been purposely excluded.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Should translations (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.po</span></code> files) be limited to general translations
for a given language (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fr</span></code>) and not include region-specific version
(e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fr_CA</span></code>)?</p></li>
<li><p>Should we offer a single explanation as to the likely cause of the error,
or do like Thonny and offer weighted alternatives?
See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aroberge/Friendly-traceback/issues/8">Issue8</a> for a discussion, as well as the section about multiple
causes below.</p></li>
<li><p>Giving too much information (“wall of text”) can be overwhelming;
giving a limited amount of information might not be helpful enough to help
beginners understand what went wrong and how to fix their program.
How do we find the right balance?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Anatomy of a standard Python traceback<a class="headerlink" href="#anatomy-of-a-standard-python-traceback" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here’s an annotated screen capture of a standard somewhat typical Python traceback:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/standard_traceback.png"><img alt="Standard Python traceback" src="_images/standard_traceback.png" style="width: 579.5px; height: 155.0px;" /></a>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Some information about the exception raised which often includes a terse message.</p></li>
<li><p>The line of code which was executed and eventually led to an exception
being raised. Most often, this will be code written by the end-user.</p></li>
<li><p>The actual line of code where the exception was raised.</p></li>
<li><p>“(most recent last call)” informs us how about the order in which the
execution occurred.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In some cases, there can be many calls in between 2 and 3; this can contribute
to the confusion experienced by beginners when they are confronted with
similar tracebacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-anatomy-of-a-friendly-traceback">
<h2>Basic anatomy of a friendly traceback<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-anatomy-of-a-friendly-traceback" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let’s have a look at a “friendly traceback” by focusing first on the items
corresponding to those we have highlighted above for a standard traceback.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/friendly_traceback_en.png"><img alt="Friendly Python traceback" src="_images/friendly_traceback_en.png" style="width: 572.5px; height: 694.5px;" /></a>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The exact same terse information provided by Python about the exception raised.</p></li>
<li><p>The line of code which was executed and eventually led to an exception
being raised, shown with a few additional lines to help understand the context.</p></li>
<li><p>The actual line of code where the exception was raised, shown with a few
additional lines to help understand the context.</p></li>
<li><p>and 5. Instead of relying simply on the “(most recent last call)” note
given by Python, we explicitly state which was the line of code where
the program stopped, and which one where the exception was raised.
This is something that can be translated, as shown for the corresponding
French version (screenshot taken with an earlier version of Friendly-traceback.)</p></li>
</ol>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/friendly_traceback_fr.png"><img alt="Friendly Python traceback" src="_images/friendly_traceback_fr.png" style="width: 543.0px; height: 254.0px;" /></a>
<p>Note that, contrarily to standard Python tracebacks, only the first and last
call made are shown.  In most cases, this should be sufficient to figure out
the cause of the exception, and how to fix it, while avoiding overwhelming
the user with too much information.</p>
<div class="section" id="other-parts-of-a-friendly-traceback">
<h3>Other parts of a friendly traceback<a class="headerlink" href="#other-parts-of-a-friendly-traceback" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In addition to what was mentioned above, here’s an annotated screen capture
highlighting the other information included in a “friendly traceback”, all
of which can be translated.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/friendly_traceback_en2.png"><img alt="Friendly Python traceback" src="_images/friendly_traceback_en2.png" style="width: 572.5px; height: 694.5px;" /></a>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A header. This could be customized if a third-party module implemented
its own custom exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Some generic information about a given exception, simply based on its
name.</p></li>
<li><p>Some specific information about this exception. For many exceptions, this
information is obtained from the message included in a standard Python
traceback. Sometimes, like in the above, it can include a suggestion as
to how to fix the problem.
Other times (see an example below for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NameError</span></code>), it is
simply rephrasing the information in the Python message which can then
be translated.</p></li>
<li><p>and 5. This shows the value of all known variables (local and global) which
are found on the lines where problems have been noted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Below is an example where the standard Python message [1] for a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NameError</span></code>
is simply rewritten [2] in English, so that it could be translated.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/name_error.png"><img alt="NameError traceback in English" src="_images/name_error.png" style="width: 478.5px; height: 197.5px;" /></a>
<p>And here is the corresponding French version:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/name_error_fr.png"><img alt="NameError traceback in French" src="_images/name_error_fr.png" style="width: 513.0px; height: 195.5px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="variable-information">
<h3>Variable information<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we include the value of all known variables found
on the offending line. In the example below (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IndexError</span></code>), this
information [1] together with the reminder [2] and the code from
the offending line [3] give enough information to properly diagnose the error.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/index_error.png"><img alt="IndexError traceback" src="_images/index_error.png" style="width: 577.0px; height: 350.0px;" /></a>
<p>In some cases, the value of some variables could, in principle,
yield an enormous amount of text.
To avoid this situation, we truncate any value that exceeds a predetermined
length. However, when we do so, if the variable has a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__len__</span></code> attribute,
we show its value as it can sometimes be helpful in identifying the problem.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/index_error2.png"><img alt="IndexError traceback" src="_images/index_error2.png" style="width: 561.0px; height: 123.5px;" /></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="syntaxerror-invalid-syntax">
<h2>SyntaxError: invalid syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#syntaxerror-invalid-syntax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code>, Python often offers very little useful information
beyond where it finally identified that a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code> occurred.
Sometimes, the offending code actually occurred well before: for example,
an open bracket might have been inserted many lines prior to where
the absence of the corresponding closing bracket was noted to cause an error.</p>
<p>For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code>, Friendly-traceback does a fairly simple analysis
of the code and tries to identify a single cause which produced the
error.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/syntax_error.png"><img alt="SyntaxError traceback" src="_images/syntax_error.png" style="width: 556.0px; height: 275.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-many-possible-causes">
<h2>How many possible causes?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-many-possible-causes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea of showing a single possible cause for a given error is different
than that taken by <a class="reference external" href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> which, in some cases, attempts to identify more than
one possible cause giving rise to an exception, as well as ordering them
in order of likelihood, based on its own analysis of the code.
Those interested by what Thonny does might want to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thonny/thonny/blob/master/thonny/plugins/stdlib_error_helpers.py">have a look here</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of showing more than one possible cause for an error
is discussed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aroberge/Friendly-traceback/issues/8">Issue8</a>.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, in the image below,
Thonny shows the normal Python traceback [1],
and offers some additional explanations [2], parts of which can be hidden
or revealed by clicking on a button.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/thonny.png"><img alt="Verbosity level 0" src="_images/thonny.png" style="width: 767.0px; height: 540.0px;" /></a>
<p>Our current thinking is as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Friendly-traceback aims to supplement the information provided by Python
in a normal traceback, in order to make it easier to understand.
Therefore, it should not second-guess the information given by Python
when the information is specific enough. For exemple, if we see an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnboundLocalError</span></code>, it could very well be that the cause is really
a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NameError</span></code> in disguise. However, trying to figure out if that is the
case would go beyond explaining and/or translating what a given
traceback includes as information.</p></li>
<li><p>For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code>, Python very often includes the rather useless
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">invalid</span> <span class="pre">syntax</span></code> message. Nonetheless, we still try to make an educated
guess as to what the cause is.  We note however that many programming
environment (editor or IDE) will include linters that will catch
syntax errors before a program is run,
thus helping to prevent <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code> tracebacks from happening.
While we could, in theory, use third-party linters as
tools in Friendly-traceback, we believe that such tools more properly
belong in a programming environment, and that it would be a duplicated
and largely wasted effort to incorporate such tools in Friendly-traceback.</p></li>
<li><p>We generally distinguish cases where we can use the information given by Python
from those where we have to guess by having a different header
(“Likely cause” vs “best guess”).</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to provide explanations and translations for all relevant
exceptions will require a considerable amount of work.
For those, like Thonny, that wishes to
explore the possibility of suggesting more than one cause, it makes sense
to add functions in Friendly-tracebacks that could perform this task
in addition to its current design, so that the community can focus on this
one package and enhance it as needed. So, Friendly-traceback must be
designed to easily allow extensions of its core capabilities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So, the choice we have made is that Friendly-traceback will normally only print
at most one likely cause.
However, some programming environment could use the additional information
about possible causes if and when it becomes available in Friendly-traceback.</p>

<div class="section" id="localization">
<h2>Localization<a class="headerlink" href="#localization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As noted above, it is possible to translate almost all the text provided
by Friendly-traceback.</p>
<p>When using Python, it is customary to determine which language should
be used to provide translations by a call to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locale.getdefaultlocale()</span></code>.  In an earlier version, we did this
but have decided to use English as the default and let the user
(which could be another program that imports Friendly-traceback)
decide what language should be used.</p>
<p>The information provided by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locale.getdefaultlocale()</span></code> includes
not only a language code, but information about a specific region as well.
For example, on my computer, this is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fr_CA</span></code>. As far as I can tell,
gettext does not have a graceful fallback from the specific (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fr_CA</span></code>)
to the generic (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fr</span></code>); it does have the option of having a fallback
to the version hard-coded in a program.</p>
<p>What we have done is including the possibility
of loading a specific translation with no fallback. If an exception is
raised, we then reduce the length of the language code to the first two
characters, and attempt to load the translation while using
gettext’s option of falling back to the hard-coded version if needed.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>By default, we should perhaps ask translators to provide generic 2-letter code
versions for translations, so that a better fallback than the default
English version could be found.  See the related open question above, as to
whether or not this should be provided in addition to any region
specific version.</p>

<p>For projects that have their custom Exceptions, like
<a class="reference external" href="https://aroberge.github.io/avantpy/docs/html/">AvantPy</a>, it is
be possible to add the custom exceptions to those handled by
Friendly-traceback.  See the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">demos</span></code> directory for an example.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a different formatter.</p>

<p>Many other projects do some enhanced traceback formatting, however
none that we know of aim at</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>making tracebacks easier to understand by beginners</p></li>

<p>Still, there is much to learn by looking at what others are doing.
